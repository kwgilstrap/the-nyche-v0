## Coding Standards

- Use **Next.js 13+ (App Router)**
- Style exclusively with **Tailwind CSS**
- All content in **Markdown** under `/src/content/`
- SSR/SSG preferred for performance
- Use **Supabase** for forms/auth if needed
- No custom CMS or backend frameworks unless scoped
- Default to **JavaScript** (TypeScript only if required)
- Modular, minimal components (e.g., `PostCard`, `Hero`)
- Comment only when logic is non-obvious

## File Structure

- `/src/components` – UI logic (e.g., CTA, Hero)
- `/src/content` – Markdown articles/services
- `/public/images` – Local assets only
- `/styles/` – Tailwind and global styles
- `/docs/` – Strategy, usage, and pinned guidance

## Editorial Voice

- Smart, dry, confident, sometimes irreverent
- Never performative or hyped
- Designed for men who read between the seams
- Every line should reflect intentional style

## Design & UX

- Editorial layout, white space is sacred
- Typography-driven hierarchy
- CTAs are soft, never spammy
- Mobile-first, fast loads

## Prohibited

- No new frameworks or major dependencies without approval
- No backend unless scoped
- No content or voice changes unless requested

## Hosting & E-comm

- Host on **Vercel**
- Embed **TikTok Shop** for e-comm
