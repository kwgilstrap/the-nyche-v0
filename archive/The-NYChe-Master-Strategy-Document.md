- No backend frameworks unless scoped (API routes, Supabase)
- No custom CMS ‚Äî **Markdown is the CMS**

**Folder Structure:**

- `/src/components` ‚Äì UI logic (CTA.js, Hero.js, etc.)
- `/src/content` ‚Äì Markdown blog/articles/services
- `/public/images` ‚Äì Local assets, not remote or bucket unless needed
- `/updates/` ‚Äì Scratchpad/backup code not in prod yet
- `/docs/` ‚Äì Strategy and guidance documents
