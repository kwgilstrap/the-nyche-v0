## The Return of Permanence

In an age of algorithmic trends and disposable fashion, a quiet revolution is underway. The most discerning men are rediscovering elements of classic menswear that have all but disappeared from the contemporary landscape—pieces that represent not merely clothing, but a philosophy of permanence in an impermanent world.

What follows isn't a trend report. It's a reintroduction to enduring elements of men's style that are experiencing a renaissance in 2025—not because they're novel, but because they're proven.

---

## 1. The Full-Canvas Jacket

**What It Is:** Unlike the fused construction that dominates today's market, a full-canvas jacket contains a layer of horsehair canvas that extends through the entire front panel, creating a garment that molds to your body over time.

**Why It's Back:** As the limitations of bonded construction become increasingly apparent (bubbling, stiffness, limited lifespan), men are rediscovering the superior drape and longevity of properly canvassed jackets.

**Where to Find It:** Beyond bespoke options from the Row, look to Drake's Games Mk. VII, Anglo-Italian, and The Armoury for ready-to-wear expressions. For the budget-conscious, vintage Brooks Brothers "346" (the old golden label, not the outlet line) routinely appears on eBay for under $200.

**How to Spot It:** Pinch the fabric between buttonholes—you should feel three distinct layers (outer cloth, canvas, lining) that move independently. The lapel should roll rather than break sharply.

---

## 2. The Proper Oxford Button-Down

**What It Is:** Not merely any button-down collar, but one cut with sufficient length and roll to create a gentle arch between collar points—the distinctive "collar roll" that's all but vanished from contemporary shirts.

**Why It's Back:** After decades of shrinking, flattening collars designed for miniature tie knots, men are rediscovering the expressive elegance of a properly proportioned collar, whether worn with or without neckwear.

**Where to Find It:** Mercer & Sons maintains the classic dimensions, while Drake's and Anglo-Italian offer excellent modern interpretations. For the uninitiated, try J. Press's "Pressidential" Oxford—still made with the proper proportions.

**How to Wear It:** The beauty of the Oxford button-down is its versatility. Wear it with a knit tie and tweed jacket for a timeless academic look, or open-collared with faded jeans for weekend ease—either way, it projects understated confidence.

---

## 3. The Substantial Loafer

**What It Is:** Unlike the dainty, glued-together slip-ons that have dominated for the past decade, the substantial penny loafer features a Goodyear-welted construction, storm welt, and robust leather that develops character with age.

**Why It's Back:** Men are rediscovering the practical elegance of footwear that improves rather than deteriorates with wear, offering decades of service rather than seasons.

**Where to Find It:** Alden's 986 in shell cordovan remains the gold standard, while Carmina offers excellent value. Drake's "Canal Penny Loafer" with its crepe sole brings a contemporary twist to the formula. For value, Meermin's penny loafer punches well above its weight class.

**How to Style It:** With everything from tailored trousers to denim, the substantial loafer bridges formal and casual worlds with effortless aplomb. The key is embracing the patina that develops—these are shoes meant to age visibly.

## 4. Pleated Trousers with Proper Rise

**What It Is:** Unlike the low-rise, flat-front silhouette that has dominated menswear since the late 1990s, proper trousers sit at your natural waist with pleats that provide comfort and elegance in motion.

**Why They're Back:** The pendulum has swung back from the restrictive discomfort of low-rise pants as men rediscover the superior comfort and proportion of trousers that flow from the body's natural waistline.

**Where to Find Them:** Spier & Mackay offers excellent value, while Berg & Berg and Drake's provide more refined options. For the highest expression, Ambrosi or Cerrato made-to-measure remains unparalleled.

**Styling Notes:** The key to modern pleated trousers is balance—avoid extremes in either width or height. The pleats should open naturally when you move without excess fullness in the thigh.

## 5. The Cricket/Tennis Sweater

**What It Is:** A V-neck cable knit sweater with contrasting trim at the neck, cuffs, and waist, originally worn for lawn sports and later adopted as casual wear by those who appreciated its distinctive character.

**Why It's Back:** As men tire of featureless knitwear, they're rediscovering the subtle character piece that bridges sportiness and refinement like nothing else in the wardrobe.

**Where to Find It:** Drake's offers a contemporary interpretation, while Ralph Lauren's cricket sweaters maintain traditional proportions. For authentic vintage examples, check The Real Real and Grailed, where 1980s examples routinely appear.

**How to Wear It:** Pair with an Oxford button-down and chinos for a classic look, or subvert expectations by wearing over a T-shirt with wide-leg denim. The contrast trim provides a focal point that makes minimalist surrounding pieces look intentional rather than bland.

---

## 6. The Six-Fold Grenadine Tie

**What It Is:** Unlike standard ties with their fused lining, a six-fold grenadine is constructed by folding the fabric upon itself multiple times, creating structure through craftsmanship rather than interfacing.

**Why It's Back:** As men wear ties more by choice than obligation, they're investing in pieces with texture, character and construction that reward close inspection.

**Where to Find It:** Drake's, E. Marinella, and Shibumi offer excellent options, with the latter providing exceptional value given the handwork involved.

**How to Recognize It:** The telltale signs are weight without stiffness, a gentle roll at the edges rather than sharp creasing, and the absence of tipping fabric at the reverse of the blade—just the same beautiful silk throughout.

---

## 7. The Unconstructed Blazer

**What It Is:** Not to be confused with the limp "unlined" jackets of recent years, the proper unconstructed blazer maintains shape through precise cutting and handwork rather than padding and fusing.

**Why It's Back:** Men are seeking jackets with the comfort of a shirt but the elevation of tailoring—pieces that can be worn thoughtfully rather than worn out.

**Where to Find It:** Drake's Games Blazer Mk.I remains a standard-bearer, while Boglioli's K-Jacket offers Italian expression of the same philosophy. For superior value, Ring Jacket's washable offerings through The Armoury provide exceptional craftwork at attainable prices.

**Styling Tip:** The magic of the unconstructed blazer lies in its versatility. Wear with a tie for a refined look or throw it over a T-shirt for elevated casual. The absence of rigid structure makes either approach work.

---

## 8. The Substantial Watch

**What It Is:** Neither oversized nor delicate, the substantial watch features a case diameter between 36-39mm, mechanical movement, and design elements that prioritize legibility and longevity over fashion.

**Why It's Back:** After years of disposable smartwatches and fashion pieces, men are rediscovering the quiet confidence that comes from wearing an instrument built to last generations.

**Where to Find It:** Beyond the obvious luxury options, consider Tudor's Black Bay 36, Omega's Aqua Terra, or for a more accessible entry point, Seiko's SARB033. The vintage market offers exceptional value with Omega Seamasters from the 1960s still available under $2,000.

**How to Wear It:** The beauty of a properly scaled watch is its versatility—it slides under a shirt cuff when needed yet doesn't disappear when worn casually. Proportion is everything; the watch should complement your wrist rather than overwhelm it.

## Final Thoughts: Beyond Trends

What unites these returning classics is their foundation in quality rather than novelty. They represent not a temporary shift in fashion's winds, but a rediscovery of principles that have always defined thoughtful men's style: appropriate proportion, quality materials, and construction methods that embrace aging rather than resist it.

In embracing these elements, you're not merely following a trend—you're participating in the continuing story of men's style, written not in seasons but in decades and centuries.
