## GitHub Authentication (Local Dev)

To enable Git operations and GitHub CLI features (e.g., pushing code, managing PRs, or accessing private repos), follow these steps to authenticate securely using a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Step 1: Install GitHub CLI

If you havenâ€™t already, install GitHub CLI:
ðŸ‘‰ <https://cli.github.com>

Or use Homebrew (macOS):

brew install gh

â¸»

Step 2: Authenticate via PAT

Run the login command:

gh auth login

Respond to prompts as follows:
 â€¢ Select: GitHub.com
 â€¢ Protocol: HTTPS
 â€¢ Authenticate Git: No
 â€¢ Authenticate GitHub CLI: Paste an authentication token

Generate a token here:
ðŸ‘‰ <https://github.com/settings/tokens>
Minimum required scopes:

repo, read:org, gist, workflow

â¸»

Step 3: Verify Auth

Confirm everything is set up:

gh auth status

You should see output like:

âœ“ Logged in to github.com as your-username
âœ“ Token scopes: repo, read:org, ...

â¸»

ðŸ›‘ Do Not Commit PATs

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) should never be committed to the repository or stored in version-controlled files like .env. GitHub CLI stores the token securely in your system keychain.

## Final Notes

The NYChe is built with intention, just like the wardrobe we advocate for. This platform represents a thoughtful approach to style, content, and technologyâ€”where each element serves a purpose and nothing is superfluous.

### Core Principles

- **Editorial First**: Content is our product. Every post should feel considered and valuable.
- **Performance Matters**: Fast loads, clean design, and responsive layouts are non-negotiable.
- **Substance Over Status**: We celebrate quality, craftsmanship, and longevity over trends.

### Development Guidelines

- Keep components modular and reusable
- Prioritize mobile experience without sacrificing desktop polish
- Maintain white space as a design element, not an afterthought
- Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android devices

This platform is a quiet rebellion against hype, clutter, and speed.  
The NYChe is where NYC men come to dress well, live slow, and move with purpose.
